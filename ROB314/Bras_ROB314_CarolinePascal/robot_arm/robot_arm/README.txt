===Important stuff here===
This package was coded for ROS Kinetic and Dynamixels AX-12A (http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/ax/ax-12a/). The 3D model of the custom robot is also included in the archive - for the curious ones.

=== Contents of the archive ===
1) DynamixeSDK, dynamixel-workbench, dynamixel-workbench-msgs : Packages used to communicate and control the dynamixels (http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_workbench/#position-controller)
Revelant files : 
- dynamixel-workbench/dynamixel_workbench_controllers/config/robot_arm.yaml
- dynamixel-workbench/dynamixel_workbench_controllers/launch/dynamixel_controllers.launch

2) robot_arm_package : Package automatically generated by the Solidworks => URDF tool (http://wiki.ros.org/sw_urdf_exporter)

3) robot_arm_moveit_config_new : Package automatically generated by the Moveit ! Setup Assistant (http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html)
Revelant files : 
- robot_arm_moveit_config_new/config/join_limits.yaml
- robot_arm_moveit_config_new/launch/grab.launch

4) robot_arm_interface : Package coded by me to ensure the communication between Moveit! and the dynamixels

5) CAD : Folder containing the CAD parts of the custom robot built on the occasion (Solidworks file type)

=== How to setup the hardware ? ===
1) Build the robot - All the necessary fixations elements and links parts are available in any bioloid beginner kit, the 3D model is here to help if needed. It works better with a screwdriver.
   [Warning] The servos must be set in the right order with the matching IDs, meaning that ID 1 must be on the base, and do on until ID 6 at the end of the arm.
2) Fix the robot on its base part - The base part need to be manufactured first, the fixation elements are available in any bioloid beginner kit.
3) Assemble the gripper - The gripper's parts need to bed printed first, and you will need four M2x40 and four M1.5x30 screws with ther corresponding nuts for the fixations.
   [Warning] The gripper's servo must have the ID 7.
4) Fix the gripper on the last joint of the robot - The fixations elements are available in any bioloid beginner kit.
5) Link all the servos together in a dasiy chain with TTL cables - Preferably 200mm ones !
6) Connect the ID 1 servo to the CM-530 controller, and then connect the controller to the USB2DYNAMIXEL, which is to be plugded in one of the PC's USB ports. It works better with a PC.
7) Connect the power cable to the controller, and press the "ON" button - You can check that the servos LED briefly light up.
8) Remove all fragile objects nearby - You are good to go :)

=== How to lauch the package ? ===
1) Run roslauch robot_arm_interface robot_arm_interface.launch
   [ProTip] If there is an issue on the dynamixel part with the servos: check their IDs (1 to 7), the USB port name (/dev/ttyUSB0) and the baud rate (57600).
2) When the launch is completed, run rosrun robot_arm_interface robot_arm_interface_node
3) Enjoy, but beware of the robot's moves (a reminder : no force control !)
   [ProTip] If Moveit! doesn't find a solution to the IK, try reducing the target pose offsets in the robot_arm_interface_node source file.
